* **Key message**  
    + Refunctionalization of the ancient rice blast disease resistance gene Pit by the recruitment of a retrotransposon as a promoter
    + We previously showed that the resistance function of the rice blast resistance gene Pit in a resistant cultivar, K59, was mainly acquired by up-regulated promoter activity through the insertion of a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon upstream of Pit
    + Here, we report that a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon contributed to the evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pit
    + The sequence and expression pattern of Pit in the five cultivars were the same as those in K59 and all showed Pit-mediated blast resistance
    + Identification of the blast resistance gene Pit in rice cultivars using functional markers
