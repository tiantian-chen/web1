* **Key message**  
    + Double knockdown/knockout of SDG711 and JMJ703 further reduced panicle size
    + Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress
    + In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress
    + Furthermore, over-expression of OsJMJ703 influenced the type of rice panicle, and knock-down of the expression of OsJMJ703 showed an earlier flowering time in rice

    + [Regulation of Histone Methylation and Reprogramming of Gene Expression in the Rice Inflorescence Meristem.](SDG711) or mutation of the H3K4 demethylase gene JMJ703 eliminated the increase of H3K27me3 in many genes
