* **Key message**  
    + Application of exogenous ABA (50 microM) resulted in a transient increase of OsTPP1 expression within 20 min of the treatment, thereby suggesting involvement of ABA in OsTPP1 gene regulation
    + Expression analysis demonstrated that OsTPP1 was initially and transiently up-regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments but slowly up-regulated under cold stress
    + OsTPP1 overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress
    + Northern blots revealed that the OsTPP1 transcript levels were fairly low or under detectable limits in most of the tissues under ambient conditions but were highly induced within 1-2 h of chilling stress (12 degrees C) in both root and shoot tissues of seedlings
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
    + Transient expression of OsTPP1 was also induced under severe chilling stress (4 degrees C) as well as salinity and drought stresses at ambient temperatures
    + Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
    + Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that OsTPP1 triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by OsTPP1
    + The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and also suggested the use of OsTPP1 in abiotic stress engineering of crops
    + Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage
    + <U+00A0>Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target OsTPP1 during chilling stress
    + OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.
    + OsTPP1 regulates seed germination through the crosstalk with abscisic acid in rice
    + <U+2022> In this study, roles of OsTPP1 on seed germination in rice were investigated
    + In addition, ABA responsive genes, especially OsABI5, were invoved in OsTPP1 mediated seed germination
    + <U+2022> Overall, our study provided new pathways in seed germination that OsTPP1 controlled seed germination through the crosstalk with ABA catabolism pathway
    + Furthermore, two of ABA catabolism genes were downregulated in tpp1 mutant which were responsible for increased ABA levels, and exogenous trehalose increased transcripts of ABA catabolism genes, suggesting that OsTPP1 and ABA catabolism genes acted in the same signaling pathway
