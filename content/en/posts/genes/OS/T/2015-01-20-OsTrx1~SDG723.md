* **Key message**  
    + Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa)
    + Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
    + However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
