* **Key message**  
    + When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant
    + Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice
    + Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions
    + Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2
