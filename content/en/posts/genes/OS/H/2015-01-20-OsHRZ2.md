* **Key message**  
    + Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2
    + OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
    + OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
    + These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency
    + Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor IDEF1
    + C1 (OE) rice plants modify the expression of the putative iron-sensing factors OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and enhance the expression of OsIRO2 under copper excess, which suggests a role of copper transport in iron signaling
    + Transgenic rice plants with repressed expression of OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 (HRZ knockdown lines) are tolerant to low iron availability and accumulate iron in shoots and seeds under both iron-sufficient and -deficient conditions without a growth penalty
