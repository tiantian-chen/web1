* **Key message**  
    + The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.
    + The haf1 mutant exhibits a later flowering heading date under both short-day and long-day conditions
    + In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions
    + HAF1 Modulates Circadian Accumulation of OsELF3 Controlling Heading Date Under Long-day Conditions in Rice.
    + An amino acid variation (L558S) within the interaction domain of OsELF3 with HAF1 greatly contributes to the variation in heading date among japonica rice accessions
    + Taken together, our findings suggest that HAF1 precisely modulates the diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation to ensure the appropriate heading date in rice
