* **Key message**  
    + In contrast to HSFA2D and LA1, OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6 (WOX6) and WOX11 in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation
    + OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 Redundantly Shape Rice Tiller Angle by Reducing HSFA2D Expression and Auxin Content
    + Genetic analysis further confirmed that OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 act upstream of HSFA2D Additionally, both OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 inhibit the expression of multiple OsYUCCA genes and decrease auxin biosynthesis
    + Taken together, these results demonstrated that OsHOX1 and OsHOX28 regulate the local distribution of auxin, and thus tiller angle establishment, through suppression of the HSFA2D-LA1 pathway and reduction of endogenous auxin content
