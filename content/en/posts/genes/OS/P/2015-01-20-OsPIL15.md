* **Key message**  
    + Microarray analysis combined with gene ontology analysis revealed that OsPIL15 represses a set of genes involved in auxin pathways and cell wall organization or biogenesis
    + Given the important roles of the auxin pathway and cell wall properties in controlling plant growth, we speculate that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth likely by regulating the auxin pathway and suppressing cell wall organization in etiolated rice seedlings
    + It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings
    + OsPIL15-OX seedlings exhibit an exaggerated shorter aboveground part and undeveloped root system relative to wild-type seedlings, suggesting that OsPIL15 represses seedling growth in the dark
    + Additionally, exposure to red light or far-red light relieved growth retardation and promoted seedling elongation in the OsPIL15-OX lines, despite higher levels of OsPIL15 transcripts under red light and far-red light than in the dark
    + Overexpression of OsPIL15, a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein gene, represses etiolated seedling growth in rice
    + An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15
    + In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function
    + Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
    + The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, OsPIL15 regulates grain size via directly targeting a purine permease gene OsPUP7 in rice.
    + Here we firstly analyzed the expression pattern of rice OsPIL genes in grains and found that OsPIL15 may play an important role in grain development
    + We then generated knock-out (KO) OsPIL15 lines in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the silencing expression of OsPIL15 led to increased numbers of cells, which thus enhanced grain size and weight
    + Moreover, overexpression and suppression of OsPIL15 in the rice endosperm resulted in brown rice showing grain sizes and weights that were decreased and increased, respectively
    + Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby OsPIL15 directly targets OsPUP7, affecting CTK transport and thereby influencing cell division and subsequent grain size
    + These findings provide a valuable insight into the molecular functions of OsPIL15 in rice grains, highlighting a useful genetic improvement leading to increased rice yield
    + Dominant-negative OsPIL15 plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism
    + Phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL15 integrates light and gravitropism to regulate tiller angle in rice.
    + Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL15 regulates tiller angle through light and gravity signals in rice
    + Here, we report that OsPIL15 is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle
    + We propose that OsPIL15 integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice
