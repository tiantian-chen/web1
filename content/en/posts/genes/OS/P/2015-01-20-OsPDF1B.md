* **Key message**  
    + OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
    + Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
    + Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria
