* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OsPT8 suppression resulted in an increase of phosphorus content in the panicle axis and in a decrease of phosphorus content in unfilled grain hulls, accompanied by lower seed-setting rate
    + In hydroponic experiments, a rice mutant defective in OsPHF1 (for phosphate transporter traffic facilitator1) lost much of the ability to take up Pi and arsenate and to transport them from roots to shoots, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing either the Pi transporter OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) or the transcription factor OsPHR2 (for phosphate starvation response2) had enhanced abilities of Pi and arsenate uptake and translocation
    + Expression of OsPT2 (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport
    + Expression of a beta-glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporter gene driven by the OsPT8 promoter showed that OsPT8 is expressed in various tissue organs from roots to seeds independent of Pi supply
    + Overexpression of OsPT8 resulted in excessive Pi in both roots and shoots and Pi toxic symptoms under the high-Pi supply condition
    + Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters
    + The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter OsPT2 and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8
    + In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8
    + Altogether, our data suggest that OsPT8 is involved in Pi homeostasis in rice and is critical for plant growth and development
    + The phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 is involved in phosphate homeostasis in rice
    + OsPT8 was able to complement a yeast Pi-uptake mutant and increase Pi accumulation of Xenopus laevis oocytes when supplied with micromolar (33)Pi concentrations at their external solution, indicating that it has a high affinity for Pi transport
    + In contrast, knockdown of OsPT8 by RNA interference decreased Pi uptake and plant growth under both high- and low-Pi conditions
    + OsPT8 was found to have a high affinity for both Pi and arsenate, and its overexpression increased the maximum influx by 3- to 5-fold
    + In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice
    + Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsPT8 plays a critical role in redistribution of P from source to sink organs and P homeostasis in seeds of rice
    + Mutation in OsPT8 in both backgrounds decreased As(V) uptake by 33-57%, increased As(V) tolerance assayed by root elongation by &gt;100-fold, and abolished the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance
    + The results show that OsPT8 plays a key role in As(V) uptake and that As(V) uptake mediated by OsPT8 exerts a profound toxic effect on root elongation
    + The role of OsPT8 in arsenate uptake and varietal difference in arsenate tolerance in rice.
    + The results also suggest that differential OsPT8 expression explains the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance between Kasalath and Nipponbare
    + Nipponbare showed 2- to 3-fold higher expression of the Pi transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 than Kasalath
    + Here, we show that OsPht1;8 (OsPT8), a phosphate transporter, functions in both the auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L
    + The Rice Phosphate Transporter Protein OsPT8 Regulates Disease Resistance and Plant Growth.
    + In this study, we identified the rice OsPT8 protein, which is a member of the phosphate transporters (PTs) Pht1 family and also plays a role in rice disease resistance
    + Overexpression of OsPT8 suppresses rice disease resistance against the pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv
    + Accordingly, the transcription level of resistance related genes, such as PAL and PBZ1, is inhibited in plants overexpressing OsPT8 (OsPT8-OX) after inoculation with these pathogens
    + We also identified OsPT8 as an interactor of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase BWMK1, which is a regulator of disease resistance
    + These results demonstrate that OsPT8 regulates the transduction of Pi signaling for development and negatively regulates rice immunity
    + Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation
    + We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
    + High Zn supply triggered P starvation signal in root, thereafter increased the activities of both root-endogenous and -secreted acid phosphatase to release more Pi, and induced the expression OsPT2 and OsPT8 to uptake more P for plant growth
    + Our results showed that high level of Zn decreased the rice biomass and yield production, and inhibited the root-to-shoot translocation and distribution of P into new leaves by down-regulating P transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 in shoot, which was controlled by OsPHR2-OsmiR399-OsPHO2 module
