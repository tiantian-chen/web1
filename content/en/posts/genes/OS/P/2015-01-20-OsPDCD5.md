* **Key message**  
    + Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice
    + Constitutive expression of OsPDCD5 from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter induced programmed cell death (PCD) in transgenic rice
    + Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice
    + In F1 hybrids made from transgenic plants with antisense-OsPDCD5 and japonica rice varieties, lower transcript inhibition could restore fertility, under certain photoperiod and temperatures
    + OsPDCD5, is an ortholog to mammalian programmed cell death 5 gene
    + ) programmed cell death 5 (OsPDCD5) gene in rice plant
    + Overexpression of the OsPDCD5 gene induces programmed cell death in rice
