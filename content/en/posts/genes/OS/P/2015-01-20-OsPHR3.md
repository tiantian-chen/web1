* **Key message**  
    + Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions
    + We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice
    + OsPHR3 affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice.
    + During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1
    + The effects of the mutation in OsPHR3 was also explicit on the seed-set and grain yield during growth in a pot soil
    + Here the role of OsPHR3 was examined in regulating the homeostasis of N under different Pi regimes
    + OsPHR3 plays a pivotal role in regulating the homeostasis of N independent of Pi availability
