* **Key message**  
    + OsPIE1 was localized to the nucleus, and expressed in epidermis, exodermis and sclerenchyma layers of primary root
    + The function of OsPIE1 in Pi homeostasis was analyzed using OsPIE1 overexpressors and ospie1 mutants
    + These results indicate that OsPIE1 plays an important role in maintaining Pi homeostasis in rice
    + Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots
    + Further comparative transcriptome analysis, tissue expression patterns and genetic interaction analysis indicated that the enhancing of Pi accumulation and APase activities upon overexpression of OsPIE1 was (at least in part) caused by repression of OsSPX2
