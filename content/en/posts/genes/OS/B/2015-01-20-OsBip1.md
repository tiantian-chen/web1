* **Key message**  
    + When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1

    + [Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice](OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions
