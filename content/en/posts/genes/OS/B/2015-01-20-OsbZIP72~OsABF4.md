* **Key message**  
    + These results suggest that OsbZIP72 plays a positive role in drought resistance through ABA signaling, and is potential useful for engineering drought tolerant rice
    + Transgenic rice overexpressing OsbZIP72 showed a hypersensitivity to ABA, elevated levels of expression of ABA response gene such as LEAs, and an enhanced ability of drought tolerance
    + Identification of OsbZIP72 as a positive regulator of ABA response and drought tolerance in rice
    + OsbZIP72 can be activated by SAPK1, and acts depending on the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway
