* **Key message**  
    + Aberrant chromosome associations and DNA fragmentations were observed after the completion of homologous pairing and synapsis in Osatm pollen mother cells (PMCs)
    + OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.
    + Together, these findings suggest that OsATM plays important roles in the accurate repair of meiotic DSBs in rice
    + Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
