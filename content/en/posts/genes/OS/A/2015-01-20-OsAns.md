    + indica) seedlings under dehydration stress or high salt or abscisic acid (ABA) showed a significant enhancement of transcript level and/or transcript stability of OsDfr and OsAns
    + Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB
    + The expression pattern of these three genes indicates that the stress responsive accumulation of OsDfr and OsAns transcripts is mediated by the transcription factor, OsC1-MYB
