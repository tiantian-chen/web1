* **Key message**  
    + OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi)
    + OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
    + The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
    + The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients
