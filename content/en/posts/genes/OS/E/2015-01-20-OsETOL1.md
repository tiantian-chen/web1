* **Key message**  
    + A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice
    + Two allelic mutants of OsETOL1 showed increased resistance to drought stress at the panicle development stage.
    + The OsETOL1 transcript was differentially responsive to abiotic stresses.

* **Connection**  
    + [A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice](ACS), which acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
