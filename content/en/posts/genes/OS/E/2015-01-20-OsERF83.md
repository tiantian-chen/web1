* **Key message**  
    + Taken together, our findings show that OsERF83 is a novel ERF transcription factor that confers blast resistance by regulating the expression of defense-related genes in rice
    + The rice ethylene response factor OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
    + Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsERF83 exhibited significantly suppressed lesion formation after rice blast infection, indicating that OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance in rice
    + OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress
    + Subcellular localization and transactivation analyses demonstrated that OsERF83 is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator
