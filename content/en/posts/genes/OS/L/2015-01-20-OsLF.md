* **Key message**  
    + Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification
    + In this study, we isolated the OsLF gene by its association with the T-DNA insertion in the rice late flowering mutant named A654
    + Overexpression of the OsLF gene in wild type rice recapitulated the late flowering phenotype of A654, indicating that the OsLF gene negatively regulates flowering
    + Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
    + An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15
    + LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF
