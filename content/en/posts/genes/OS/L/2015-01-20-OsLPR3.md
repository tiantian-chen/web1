* **Key message**  
    + Identification and expression analysis of OsLPR family revealed the potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.
    + The results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of OsLPR family with potential roles of OsLPR3 and 5 in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice
    + Pi deficiency (-P) triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of OsLPR3 and 5
