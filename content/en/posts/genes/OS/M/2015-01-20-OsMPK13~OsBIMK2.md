* **Key message**  
    + Expression of OsBIMK2 was also up-regulated during early stage after inoculation with MAGNAPORTHE GRISEA in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during an incompatible interaction between M
    + Expression of OSBIMK2 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice
    + Over-expression of the rice OSBIMK2 gene in transgenic tobacco resulted in an enhanced disease resistance against tomato mosaic virus and a fungal pathogen, ALTERNARIA ALTERNATA
    + These results suggest that OSBIMK2 plays a role in disease resistance responses
    + A novel rice MAPK gene, OsBIMK2, is involved in disease-resistance responses
