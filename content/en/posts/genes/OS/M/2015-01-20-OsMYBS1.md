* **Key message**  
    + Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas OsMYBS3 represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation
    + Two-hybrid experiments with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 is able to form a homodimer
