    + [New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=New+insights+into+the+dimerization+of+small+GTPase+Rac/ROP+guanine+nucleotide+exchange+factors+in+rice.%5BTitle%5D), 2015, Plant Signal Behav.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER
