* **Key message**  
    + Results show that OsRacB transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment
    + A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea
    + Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens
    + In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene OsRacB and plant salt tolerance
    + This suggests that overexpression of OsRacB in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance
    + The results indicated that OsRacB is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance
    + Rice GTPase OsRacB: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling
    + Promoter analysis showed that OsRacB promoter is induced by salinity and exogenous salicylic acid, not abscisic acid
    + The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid
    + To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a phylogeny of function approach to rice Rops, and identified OsRacB based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance
    + Based on these results, we suggest that OsRacB functions as a potential regulator for a basal disease resistance pathway in rice
