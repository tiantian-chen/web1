* **Information**  
    + Symbol: OsSUS7  
    + MSU: [LOC_Os04g17650](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g17650)

* **Publication**  
    + [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification+and+characterization+of+the+duplicate+rice+sucrose+synthase+genes+OsSUS5+and+OsSUS7+which+are+associated+with+the+plasma+membrane%5BTitle%5D), 2011, Mol Cells.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + RT-PCR analysis and transient expression assays revealed that OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 exhibit similar expression patterns in rice tissues, with the highest expression evident in roots

* **Connection**  
    + [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](OsSUS) gene family, which shows only nine single nucleotide substitutions in the OsSUS5 coding sequence
    + [Identification and characterization of the duplicate rice sucrose synthase genes OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 which are associated with the plasma membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Identification+and+characterization+of+the+duplicate+rice+sucrose+synthase+genes+OsSUS5+and+OsSUS7+which+are+associated+with+the+plasma+membrane%5BTitle%5D), Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the synteny between OsSUS5 and OsSUS7 is conserved, and that significant numbers of transposable elements are scattered at both loci
