* **Key message**  
    + OsGORK was expressed to some degree in most tissues, such as leaf blade, node, leaf sheath and root, but at high levels in flowers
    + Differential gene expression of two outward-rectifying shaker-like potassium channels OsSKOR and OsGORK in rice
    + A dual role for the OsK5.2 ion channel in stomatal movements and K+ loading into xylem sap.
    + This trait was conferred by at least three complementary mechanisms: (1) its superior ability to activate H+-ATPase pump operation, both at transcriptional and functional levels; (2) reduced sensitivity of K+ efflux channels to reactive oxygen species; and (3) smaller upregulation in OsGORK and higher upregulation of OsAKT1 in tolerant cultivars in response to salt stress

* **Connection**  
    + [OsNAC2 positively affects salt-induced cell death and binds to the OsAP37 and OsCOX11 promoters.](OsGORK+and+OsSKOR) were obviously activated by OsNAC2
    + [Tissue-Specific Regulation of Na+ and K+ Transporters Explains Genotypic Differences in Salinity Stress Tolerance in Rice.](3) smaller upregulation in OsGORK and higher upregulation of OsAKT1 in tolerant cultivars in response to salt stress
