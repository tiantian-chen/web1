* **Key message**  
    + All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages
    + Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80 % reductions)
    + Foliar ascorbate concentrations were significantly increased in 35S-OsGGP plants in the vegetative growth phase relative to NS, but significantly reduced at the reproductive growth phase and were associated with reduced OsGGP transcript levels

* **Connection**  
    + [Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice Oryza sativa L..](OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels
