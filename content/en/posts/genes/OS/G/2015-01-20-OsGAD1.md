* **Publication**  
    + [Rice Oryza sativa contains a novel isoform of glutamate decarboxylase that lacks an authentic calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus](BBA) - Gene Structure and Expression.

* **Genbank accession number**  
    + [AB056062](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB056062)

* **Key message**  
    + RNA analysis showed that transcripts of OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 were present in all tissues examined, but their expression was differentially regulated, at least in roots and maturing seeds
    + We have isolated full-length cDNAs for two distinct isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), designated OsGAD1 and OsGAD2 from a rice shoot cDNA library
