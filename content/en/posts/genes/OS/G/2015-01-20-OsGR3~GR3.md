* **Key message**  
    + In this work, we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA encoding OsGR3, a chloroplast-localized GR that up to now was considered as a non-functional enzyme because of assumed lack of N-terminal conserved domains
    + OsGR3 shows 76 and 53 % identity with OsGR1 (chloroplastic) and OsGR2 (cytosolic), respectively
    + A plastid transit peptide is located at the N terminus of OsGR3, and genetic transformation of rice with a GR3-GFP fusion construct further confirmed its localization in chloroplasts
    + Furthermore, OsGR1 and OsGR3 are also targeted to mitochondria, which suggest a combined antioxidant mechanism in both chloroplasts and mitochondria
    + In addition, the transcript level of OsGR3 was greatly increased with salicylic acid treatment but was not significantly affected by methyl jasmonate, dehydration or heat shock stress
    + In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots
    + On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA
    + However, both isoforms showed a distinct response to salinity: the expression of OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was induced by salt stress
    + Our results provide new clues about the possible roles of functional OsGR3 in salt stress and biotic stress tolerance
    + Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome
    + Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of glutathione reductase identified in the rice genome
    + The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl
    + NaCl-induced OsGR2 and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component
    + The expression of OsGR2 and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl
    + However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced OsGR2 and OsGR3 induction
    + Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of OsGR2 and OsGR3 in NaCl-treated rice roots
    + Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of OsGR2 and OsGR3 expression in NaCl-treated rice roots
    + GR3 promoter-GUS was expressed in the vascular cylinder and cortex of root tissues in rice seedlings, vascular tissue of nodes, embryo and aleurone layer of seeds, and young flowers
    + Previously, we showed that salt-stress-responsive GR3 is a functional protein localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria in rice
    + Rice GR3 was primarily expressed in roots at the seedling stage and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues except the sheath at heading stage
    + Oxidative stress, indicated by malondialdehyde content, was greater in gr3 than the WT under salt stress
    + As compared with the WT, gr3 was sensitive to salt and methyl viologen; it showed inhibited growth, decreased maximal efficiency of photosystem II, decreased GSH and GSSG contents, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG
    + These results reveal that GR3 plays an important role in salt stress tolerance by regulating the GSH redox state in rice
    + To learn more about the role of GR3 in salt-stress tolerance, we investigated the response to 100Â mM NaCl treatment in wild-type rice (WT); GR3 knockout mutant of rice (gr3); and the functional gr3-complementation line (C1)
