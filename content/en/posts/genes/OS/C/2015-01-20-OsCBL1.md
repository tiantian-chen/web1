    + The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex
    + Here, we report that OsCBL1 also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth
    + The calcium sensor OsCBL1 modulates nitrate signaling to regulate seedling growth in rice.
    + Overall, our results showed a novel role for OsCBL1 in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth
