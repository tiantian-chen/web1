    + [AK111834](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK111834)

* **Key message**  
    + Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
    + Taken together, OsCML3 probably provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory switch

* **Connection**  
    + [C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein](OsHMGB1) protein was identified as one of the putative OsCML3 target proteins
