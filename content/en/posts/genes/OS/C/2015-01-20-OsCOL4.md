* **Key message**  
    + OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days
    + In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment
    + By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways
    + In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB
    + OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
    + A minimum of four group A alleles of DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are required for the growth of cultivated rice at latitudes above 30°„N
    + Genetic variations in DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are correlated with differences in heading date and the correlation between the genetic diversity of Hd6 and Se5 and rice heading data are weak
    + One group of haplotypes of DTH8, Ghd7, Hd1, DTH7, PhyB, and OsCOL4 are associated with earlier heading dates and appear to have accumulated during the northward expansion of rice cultivation
