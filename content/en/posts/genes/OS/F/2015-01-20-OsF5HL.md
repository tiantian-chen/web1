    + [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](Oryza+sativa+L), We have isolated twoF5H genes,OsF5HL andOsF5HL2, from a japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa L
    + [Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase](ORF) of 1590 b from four exons, whileOsF5HL2 has an ORF of 1560 b from two exons
