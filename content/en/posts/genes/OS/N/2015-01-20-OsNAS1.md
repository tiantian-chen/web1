* **Key message**  
    + RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1
    + Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron
    + In Fe-deficient plants, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in the vascular bundles of green leaves and in all cells of leaves showing severe chlorosis
    + OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 transcripts were detected in Fe-sufficient roots but not in leaves, and levels of both increased markedly in both roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency
    + Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem
    + With Fe deficiency, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 expression extended to all root cells along with an increase in phytosiderophore secretion
