    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](NSP1) and NSP2 are essential for rhizobium Nod factor-induced nodulation
    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](Oryza+sativa) NSP1 and NSP2, indicating that both proteins are functionally conserved in higher plants
    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](SL) biosynthesis in the legume Medicago truncatula and in rice
    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone+biosynthesis+in+Medicago+truncatula+and+rice+requires+the+symbiotic+GRAS-type+transcription+factors+NSP1+and+NSP2%5BTitle%5D), The disturbed SL biosynthesis in nsp1 nsp2 mutant backgrounds correlates with reduced expression of DWARF27, a gene essential for SL biosynthesis
    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone+biosynthesis+in+Medicago+truncatula+and+rice+requires+the+symbiotic+GRAS-type+transcription+factors+NSP1+and+NSP2%5BTitle%5D), Therefore, we conclude that regulation of SL biosynthesis by NSP1 and NSP2 is an ancestral function conserved in higher plants
    + [Strigolactone biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula and rice requires the symbiotic GRAS-type transcription factors NSP1 and NSP2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Strigolactone+biosynthesis+in+Medicago+truncatula+and+rice+requires+the+symbiotic+GRAS-type+transcription+factors+NSP1+and+NSP2%5BTitle%5D), NSP1 and NSP2 are single-copy genes in legumes, which implies that both proteins fulfill dual regulatory functions to control downstream targets after rhizobium-induced signaling as well as SL biosynthesis in nonsymbiotic conditions

    + [Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Function+of+GRAS+proteins+in+root+nodule+symbiosis+is+retained+in+homologs+of+a+non-legume,+rice%5BTitle%5D), In this study, we demonstrated that their homologs, OsNSP1 and OsNSP2, from rice are able to fully rescue the RN symbiosis-defective phenotypes of the mutants of corresponding genes in the model legume, Lotus japonicus
    + [Function of GRAS proteins in root nodule symbiosis is retained in homologs of a non-legume, rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Function+of+GRAS+proteins+in+root+nodule+symbiosis+is+retained+in+homologs+of+a+non-legume,+rice%5BTitle%5D), Two GRAS-domain transcription factors, NSP1 and NSP2, have been shown to be required for RN symbiosis, but not for AM symbiosis
    + [Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis](OsNSP2), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis
    + [Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 7 controls tiller number by regulating strigolactone synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Rice+GROWTH-REGULATING+FACTOR+7+controls+tiller+number+by+regulating+strigolactone+synthesis%5BTitle%5D),  Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the expression level of OsNSP2 and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds
