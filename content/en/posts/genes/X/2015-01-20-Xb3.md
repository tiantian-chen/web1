* **Key message**  
    + Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance
    + These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance.

* **Connection**  
    + [Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance](XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase

    + [Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.](XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four tyrosine residues are not required for their interaction
