* **Key message**  
    + We show that LA1, a novel grass-specific gene, is temporally and spatially expressed, and plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT)
    + Here we report the cloning of the LAZY1 (LA1) gene that regulates shoot gravitropism by which the rice tiller angle is controlled
    + Loss-of-function of LA1 enhances PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants
    + LA1 is able to rescue the tiller angle and shoot gravitropism defects observed in la1-SN
    + LA1 is required to regulate the expression of auxin transporters and signaling factors that control shoot gravitropism and tiller angle
    + The results show that LA1 may be involved in the nucleosome and chromatin assembly, and protein-DNA interactions to control gene expression, shoot gravitropism, and tiller angle
    + Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms whereby LA1 controls shoot gravitropism and tiller angle in rice

    + [OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=OsBRXL4+Regulates+Shoot+Gravitropism+and+Rice+Tiller+Angle+through+Affecting+LAZY1+Nuclear+Localization.%5BTitle%5D),  Further genetic evidence confirmed that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting LA1 nuclear localization
