* **Key message**  
    + The well-characterized secretory glycoprotein, rice (Oryza sativa) alpha-amylase isoform I-1 (AmyI-1), was localized within the plastids and proved to be involved in the degradation of starch granules in the organelles of rice cells
    + Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone
    + CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds
    + The gibberellin-inducible rice α-amylase gene, RAmy1A, was demonstrated to be sugar repressed in rice embryos and functional dissection of the promoter of RAmy1A in relation of its sugar-modulated expression was performed
