* **Key message**  
    + Map-based cloning demonstrated that TIP3 encodes a conserved PHD-finger protein and further study confirmed TIP3 functioned as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity
    + The tip3 mutant displayed smaller and pale yellow anthers without mature pollen grains, abnormal Ubisch body morphology, no pollen wall formation as well as delayed tapetum degeneration
    + Moreover, TIP3 can physically interact with TDR which is a key component of the transcriptional cascade in regulating tapetum development and pollen wall formation
    + Taken together, our results reveal an unprecedented role of TIP3 in regulating Ubisch bodies and pollen exine formation, which presents a potential tool to manipulate male fertility for hybrid rice breeding
    + TIP3 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores during anther development
    + Furthermore, disruption of TIP3 changed the expression of several genes involved in tapetum development and degradation, biosynthesis and transport of lipid monomers of sporopollenin in tip3 mutant
