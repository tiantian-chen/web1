* **Key message**  
    + Sequence of the candidate genes in the target region revealed that a base transversion from G to C occurred in the 5' untranslated region of Sdt97 qRT-PCR results confirmed that the transversion induced obvious change in the expression pattern of Sdt97 at different growth and developmental stages
    + A semi- dwarf mutant gene Sdt97 was previously described

* **Connection**  
    + [Sdt97, a Point Mutation in 5' Untranslated Region, Confers Semi-dwarfism in Rice.](RHL) population, Sdt97 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at the interval nearly 60 kb between STS marker N6 and SNP marker N16 within the PAC clone P0453H04
