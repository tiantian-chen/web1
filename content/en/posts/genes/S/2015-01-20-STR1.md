* **Key message**  
    + Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes
    + The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice
    + Analogous to STR1 and STR2, at the root cortex level, the antiSTR1 transcript is specifically detected in arbusculated cells, suggesting unexpected modes of STR1 regulation in rice
    + Malnutrition of the fungus underlying limited arbuscular growth was excluded by the absence of complementation of the str1 phenotype by wild-type nurse plants
    + Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
    + However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2
