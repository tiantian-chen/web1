    + [Se14, encoding a JmjC domain-containing protein, plays key roles in long-day suppression of rice flowering through the demethylation of H3K4me3 of RFT1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Se14,+encoding+a+JmjC+domain-containing+protein,+plays+key+roles+in+long-day+suppression+of+rice+flowering+through+the+demethylation+of+H3K4me3+of+RFT1.%5BTitle%5D), 2014, PLoS One.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We conclude that Se14 is a novel photoperiod-sensitivity gene that has a suppressive effect on floral transition (flowering time) under long day-length conditions through the modification of chromatin structure by H3K4me3 demethylation in the promoter region of RFT1
