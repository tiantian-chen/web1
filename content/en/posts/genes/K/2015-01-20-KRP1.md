* **Key message**  
    + Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development
    + The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice
    + Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation
    + However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants
    + Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells
    + The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development
    + Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling
