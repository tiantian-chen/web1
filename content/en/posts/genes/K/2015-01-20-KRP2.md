* **Key message**  
    + Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors KRP1 and KRP2 Are Involved in Grain Filling and Seed Germination in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
    + KRP1 overexpression transgenic lines (OxKRP1), krp2 single mutant (crkrp2), and krp1/krp2 double mutant (crkrp1/krp2) all exhibited significantly smaller seed width, seed length, and reduced grain weight, with impaired seed germination and retarded early seedling growth, suggesting that disturbing the normal steady state of KRP1 or KRP2 blocks seed development partly through inhibiting cell proliferation and enlargement during grain filling and seed germination
