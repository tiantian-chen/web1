* **Key message**  
    + In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed
    + Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice
    + To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs
    + Constitutive overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1
