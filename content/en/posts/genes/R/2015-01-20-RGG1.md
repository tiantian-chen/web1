* **Key message**  
    + Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.
    + The present study provides evidence of a unique function of RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice without affecting yield
    + The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl
    + Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries
    + Overexpression of RGG1 in Nipponbare (NIP) and Wuyunjing 30 (WYJ30) significantly decreased plant height, panicle length and grain length by regulating cell division
