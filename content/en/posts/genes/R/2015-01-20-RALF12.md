    + [Profiling of rice Cd-tolerant genes through yeast-based cDNA library survival screening](RALFs) were of particular interest, and their function of Cd tolerance was further validated via heterologous expression, which suggested that SNAC1, RALF12, OsBI-1 can confer Cd tolerance in yeast and tobacco leaves
