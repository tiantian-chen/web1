* **Information**  
    + Symbol: HKT2  
    + MSU: None  
    + RAPdb: None  

* **Publication**  
    + [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Two+types+of+HKT+transporters+with+different+properties+of+Na++and+K++transport+in+Oryza+sativa%5BTitle%5D), 2001, The Plant Journal.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2)
    + These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice

* **Connection**  
    + [Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa](Po-OsHKT1,+Po-OsHKT2))
