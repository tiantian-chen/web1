    + [CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice](CYP) mono-oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock-down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation
