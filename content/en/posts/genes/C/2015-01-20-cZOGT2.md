    + [Cytokinin activity of cis-zeatin and phenotypic alterations induced by overexpression of putative cis-Zeatin-O-glucosyltransferase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Cytokinin+activity+of+cis-zeatin+and+phenotypic+alterations+induced+by+overexpression+of+putative+cis-Zeatin-O-glucosyltransferase+in+rice%5BTitle%5D), 2012, Plant Physiol.

* **Genbank accession number**  

* **Key message**  
    + Transgenic rice lines ectopically overexpressing the cZOGT1 and cZOGT2 genes exhibited short-shoot phenotypes, delay of leaf senescence, and decrease in crown root number, while cZOGT3 overexpressor lines did not show shortened shoots
