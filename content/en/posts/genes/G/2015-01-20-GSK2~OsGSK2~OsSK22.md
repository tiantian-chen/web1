* **Key message**  
    + Overexpression of GSK2 (Go) led to plants with typical BR loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppression of GSK2 resulted in enhanced BR signaling phenotypes
    + Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses
    + These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses
    + Together, these results suggest that OsGSK2 is selected to regulate mesocotyl length by coordinating strigolactone and brassinosteroid signaling during domestication
    + Variations in the coding region of OsGSK2 alter its kinase activity
    + In addition, the stability of OsPUB24 was downregulated by BL and bikinin, an inhibitor of OsSK22 (Oryza sativa Shaggy/GSK3-like kinase 22)
    + OsGSK2 physically interacts with OsMYC2, resulting in the degradation of OsMYC2 by phosphorylation and reduces JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection
